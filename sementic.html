            <h1>INtro to coding</h1>
            <article>In today’s digital world, coding is no longer just a skill for computer scientists — it’s becoming a fundamental literacy for all students. Learning to code helps children understand how <br>the technology around them works and encourages them to become creators, not just consumers.

<br>One of the biggest benefits of coding is that it teaches problem-solving. When students write code,<br> they learn how to break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This logical thinking applies not just to tech, but to <br>real-life challenges as well.

Coding also promotes creativity. Whether students are designing a simple game or building a website, <br>they’re using imagination and innovation to bring ideas to life. It boosts confidence as they see their code turn into something meaningful.</article>
